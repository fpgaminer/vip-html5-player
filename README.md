Aersia Playlist - HTML5 Player
======================================


I modified the amazing vip-html5-player and changed the design to a dracula like theme. The web requests are using now https.

"Vidya Intarweb Playlist" HTML5 Player
================

["Vidya Intarweb Playlist"](http://www.aersia.net/threads/vip-and-wap-faqs.8/) is a fantastic video game playlist maintained by Cats777 over at [Aersia.net](http://www.aersia.net).  The VIP has been one of my main sources of background music while working.

This is an HTML5-based replacement player for the VIP.  I created it because the original player for the VIP is Flash-based.  Since Flash is outdated and insecure, I decided to hack together a new player.  Now the "Vidya Intarweb Playlist" is accessible on all my devices.

What's Different
================

I cloned the aesthetic of the original VIP player, so everything looks and feels the same.  There are a few differences and improvements.

**Differences**

 * The context menu has been replaced by a small credits box in the lower right corner, to properly credit Cats777 and link back to Aersia.
 
**Missing**
 * Optimizing style and behavior of volume controls

**New**
 * Next Track button goes to a random track, instead of next in the playlist.
 * Previous Track button goes to the track previously played, instead of the previous in the playlist.
 * Playlist Selection dropdown.  Easily switch between the different VIP playlists (VIP, Mellow, Source, Exiled, WAP, CPP).


Compatibility
=============

This player should be compatible with all modern devices and browsers that support HTML5 and M4A (AAC) audio files.  If you run into any bugs, let me know!

I have tested the current version on Firefox (Ubuntu), iPhone 5, and iPad 3.  On the latter two, the playlist doesn't play automatically the first time; just tap a track to begin.  Also, on the iPhone the player controls are incredibly tiny.  Both bugs will be fixed.
